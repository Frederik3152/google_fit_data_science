# google_fit_data_science
## Code Introduction
This project is a data science portfolio project, and therefore goes through several of the key data science techniques, 
including data cleaning, machine learning evaluation, exploratory data analysis and data visualization. 
The main libraries used are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.

The project is concerned with drawing conclusions from my own activity metrics grabbed from the Google Fit API (www.takeout.google.com). 
And thereby aims to answer the following questions:
1. What is the weekly distribution of walking distance and is there a difference in walking speed across the week?
2. Which weekday is the most common of not hitting 10,000 steps?
3. How has my walking pattern evolved over time?
4. What is the relationship between walking speed, walking distance and burned calories?
